Further up the wall you’ll find Corbridge Roman Town, the most northern town in the empire. The archaeology here is remarkable, a testament to how important this place was.

Mary Tudor amassed troops here before becoming queen, with her sister Elizabeth later turning it into a prison.

Now, you can visit the site of this pivotal moment in English history, exploring the ruins of the Norman abbey built to commemorate the victory.

      title: Pendennis Castle
      description: On an elevated spit facing the ocean sits Pendennis Castle, a strategic fort set to protect the harbour of Falmouth. Pendennis was built by Henry VIII in 1539, during a vast period of fortress building – since declaring himself independent of the Catholic church, the whole of Catholic Europe was threatening attack. Reinforced in the years to come, the true test of the stronghold’s defenses came during the Civil War where Parliamentarians laid siege to the castle for three long months. Now, hear the dramatic blast of historic guns before discovering the castle’s role in WW1 at the new exhibition, Fortress Falmouth and the First World War.

      title: Tintagel Castle
      description: Tintagel is one of the most romantic, evocative ruins in the country, a famed Cornish beauty spot that lingers thick with Arthurian legend and local myths. The castle ruins cling to the rough headland that dramatically falls to the sea, making for a truly spellbinding site to explore. Dating back to the 13th century, with a much older Dark Age settlement also uncovered, Tintagel Castle offers a wealth of history ripe for unpicking, in a setting that is truly breathtaking in its beauty. Discover the Legend of King Arthur for yourself, before heading down the steep steps to the picturesque beach below.
